This repository demonstrates a subtle type safety issue in TypeScript where type coercion can lead to unexpected results at runtime. The `add` function is declared to accept two numbers, but it can still accept a string due to type coercion. This leads to string concatenation rather than addition. The bug is that type safety is not as strict as expected and the solution highlights ways to enhance type safety.
